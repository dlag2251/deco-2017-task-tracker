# Task Tracker

For this tracking application, I cloned and adapted the template repository as provided to the class (found at <https://github.com/robdongas/deco2017-task-tracker>).

This application can be run using parcel, I used the npm run dev command to start the server each time.

Note:
I made many attempts to implement the image functionality and local storage as proposed in the design brief. Unfortunately I could not get this to work and due to time constraints I was unsuccessful, and left the tracker functional in a more stripped down form. I figured it would be better to leave the tracker in a more basic state where it could still be run on its own server, because with the other errors when trying to implement local storage/images it would no longer run at all (particularly when I added the .parcelrc file). I left the code (commented out) from my attempts to adapt it at the bottom of the script.js file. I recognize that this will likely lead to substantial point deductions but I am just aiming for partial credit where possible.
